Gjiten kai - グジテン改

A modern, partial rewrite of Gjiten, a japanese dictionary for Gnome.

= Goal =
The goal of this rewrite of Gjiten is to have a Gjiten on which new features 
can be more easly added in the future. 

= Differances with the original Gjiten =
*entirely rewrited user interface
**Use GTK3 with GladeBuilder

*Core
**code factorization, comments, cleanup...
**complete separation between core functions and user interface functions

*Misc
**Renamed 'English' by 'Latin' in the interface and the source code
  (English uses Latin characters, and gjiten can be use to search in 
  several language versions of edict dictionaries)
**Uses CMake to generate the Makefile (see Build section)
