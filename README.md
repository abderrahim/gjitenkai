# Goal
The goal of this rewrite of Gjiten is to have a Gjiten with new features and a
new interface, while keeping the original overall design. 

#Prerequistes

## Edict 
To use the worddic (word dictionary) you will need an edict file encoded in UTF-8
The official edict dictionary is encoded in EUC-JP.

Then set the worrdic file in Edit/preferences/ Worddic - Dictionary - New - Browse ...  

## Other

You also need Japanese font and a Japanse input system. See your OS documentation
for more details.
